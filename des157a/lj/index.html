        A design for form needs many considerations from different perspectives. Different audiences may experience differently. The color balance and visual elements drive a category of the form. A food survey and a health survey reveal distinct visual perceptions. However, the overall organization and the visual elements of the form could determine the audience's first impression. There are several components that contribute to an effective design form: line proximity, labels, formats, and field size, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
        A good form design considers its usability and its interactive experience. Most people have the experience to fill out a form and they have the assessment as a user. I think a form should have a directional leading layout that easily directs the audience to a right place for filling each part of information. The line spacing and text hierarchy are some of the considerations that define a user experience. A clear formatted form will make an easier and a relaxed interactive experience. There are many other visual elements that need to be considered and I believe receiving feedback from user experience could be a good opportunity to improve my designed form.

    <p>In the article “Best Practice for Modal’, the author Naema Baskanderi demonstrates how interface affect interactive experience from the user's perspective. An overlay window could distract or attract the user's attention. I think it is important to make coherency between the overlay window with the theme of the main window. An overlay window could popup for sign in or enter user’s information. An immersive window design could attract attention and extend the design environment. 
    </p>

    
    <p>When an overlay window shows up randomly, it may disrupt the user's browsing experience and may impact users to exit the main window. As Baskanderi mentions, a cancellation button or a close button play an important role for users to have the choice to exit. The goal for a button is to guide the user and respond explicitly to the user's options. The context of the button should not be equivocal and it should easily tell the next action.
