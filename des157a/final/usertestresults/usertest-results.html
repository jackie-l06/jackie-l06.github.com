            Feedback from <em>Mahima</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="content">
            When Mahima starts to navigate the page, she did not know how to scroll the images. The scroll bar will appear as hovering over it, but I think it was kind of unnoticeable to realize. Mahima as a Microsoft computer user doesnâ€™t know the function of the
            mouse pad on the MacBook, which I think I still need to work on the scrolling part of my project for user consideration. I will definitely need to update a new method to indicate the scrolling.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Feedback from <em>Louis</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="content">
            Louis had the same problem of browsing the photos and also not knowing the scrollbar when you hover over it. He provided many ideas for me to improve the user interactive experience, such as adding an opening animation of the camera tape, adding a category
            of the photography collection, and also adding more visual elements on the camera tape. I will update the visual components and adjust the JavaScript to create a better and more creative interaction for the users.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Feedback from <em>Julia</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="content">
            Julia had the same experiences with the other two testers and I think the scrolling will be definitely a problem that needs to be solved. She provides many suggestions on how could I organize the content and user experience on the scrolling. The user
            experience of navigating the photography is a challenge that I need to keep working on. There are other considerations of user navigations that I will continually develop, such as the background setting while browsing, the visual balance of
            the objects, the functionality of the interface.
