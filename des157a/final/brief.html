    </header>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I plan to update the studio 2 project, which focuses on the showcase of photos. I want to put the page in a more professional way that well-presents my photography.
    </p>

    <h3>Comparison Project 1:</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://eumray.com/"></a>
        On this website, I find many inspirational ideas that have many professional interactive details. The website reflects personal characteristics from the publisher. As you open the page, the simple use of color makes other visual elements more outstanding.
        The Korean characters demonstrate the publisher’s identity and background. The interface expresses an acknowledgment about the publisher while having an immersive interactive experience. I think one thing for improvement is that the fluency of
        the scrolling experience down a personal webpage. There are great details to display, but they could possibly lead to a downward interactive fluidity for different types of users.
    </p>

    <h3>Comparison Project 2:</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-7/
        "></a>
        The above link is from Apple’s official product website. The website is a showcase of its new product, Apple Watch Series 7. Apple shows great details about its product design and presents a comparison with past Apple products. Also, the description of
        Apple’s product has a strong visual hierarchy for the audience to easily recognize and understand. Each scrolling the audience could take a closer look at the product and get a better understanding of its functionality. I think Apple incorporates
        well with the interactive interface to introduce their product. The interface shows consistency and representative to perform Apple’s interactive style.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
    <p>
        My projects will be based on a showcase of my photography. From the feedback session on the Studio 2 project, I have received much helpful feedback that I could continuously work on. I will stay with the visual elements and the ideas I had. I think the
        idea of camera tapes still works well with the setting of a photography showcase. I think the photography incorporates well with the camera roll as the main setting to browse the photography. As I change the background color to a plain color,
        I could make the title of the page more stand out. Since I received suggestions about the title and background color from the feedback session. Then I will continue to extend the interactive experience and create something other than scrolling.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Strategies: </h3>
    <p>
        Since I received feedback about changing the background color of my overall design interface, I think I will plan to have a plain color scheme. The yellow-greenish color makes the overall design less professional. I will try to stay with white or black
        as my color theme. In addition, I want to update the visual elements for a more illustrated and professional look. The illustration of the camera tape could enhance more details or better color combinations. The visual strategies will focus on
        a simple and professional overall look. I could change the proximity of each presenting photography and create a better interaction between the user and the photography.
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies: </h3>
    <p>
        I plan to updates the interactive experience betwee the user with my photography. The scrolling and clicking could enhance more creative interactions. I will be more considerate on the scrolling part of the photography. The scrollbar was only functioned
        from scrolling left and right, which might fit Macbook users with the mousepad, but not other types of computer users using the mouse. I plan to incorporate the scrollbar with wedges that make other types of computer users easier to interact with.
        Other interaction strategies will focus on user feasibility and combine with some interesting visual elements to boost user engagement.
